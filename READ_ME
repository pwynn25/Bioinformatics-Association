Welcome to the first ever bioinformatics hackathon
We are excited you are here!

This coding task involves pipelines. We are running DNA through a series of softwares in hopes to get an output that we can understand. The problem is some of the files we need to run tests further down the pipeline require
outputs of the previous tests that are inside directories with random names. Let's solve this problem with some code!


please create a random directory to get started with the challenge!

enter this into your IDE terminal:
python3 GenerateFile

this should have generated a file titled "randomSlurm.out"

Your task:
go inside this file to find the name of the directory created that contains the "consensi.fa.classified" file
Once you have extracted the directory name, go inside and print the contents of the "consensi.fa.classified" file
Good luck!
